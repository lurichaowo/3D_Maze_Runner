# 3D_Maze_Runner

##### This 3D Maze Runner Game was another project I had completed along with my partner, Deryke Tang, this assignment was talored towards the halloween theme. The basic concept of this game was essentially a scavenger hunt in which you had to navigate yourself in a randomly generated maze and locate 6 of the children the witch kidnapped. This is a project made in Unity and is the first time I had collabrated with someone on.

##### To run open "MazeRun.exe" and enjoy.
