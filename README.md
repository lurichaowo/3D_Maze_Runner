# 3D_Maze_Runner

##### This 3D Maze Runner Game was another project I had completed along with my partner, Deryke Tang, this assignment was talored towards the halloween theme. The basic concept of this game was essentially a scavenger hunt in which you had to navigate yourself in a randomly generated maze and locate 6 of the children the witch kidnapped.
